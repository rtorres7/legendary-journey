        content: [
            '(U) Russian missiles struck an apartment block and close to a kindergarten in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday (Jun 26), in strikes US President Joe Biden condemned as "barbarism" as world leaders gathered in Europe to discuss further sanctions against Moscow. Up to four explosions shook central Kyiv in the early hours, in the first such attack on the city in weeks.',
            "(U) A Reuters photographer saw a large blast crater near a playground in a kindergarten that had smashed windows. Deputy Mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said one person was killed and six wounded. He said explosions heard later in other parts if Kyiv were air defences destroying further incoming missiles. Russia has stepped up air strikes on Ukraine this weekend, which has also seen the fall of a strategic eastern city to pro-Russian forces.",
            "(U) Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said G7 countries should respond to the latest missile strikes by imposing further sanctions on Russia and providing more heavy weapons to Ukraine. As Europe's biggest land conflict since World War Two entered its fifth month, the Western alliance supporting Kyiv was starting to show signs of strain as leaders fret about the growing economic cost.",
            "(U) British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the West needed to maintain a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin. At Sunday's G7 meeting, Britain, Canada, Japan and the United States proposed a ban on imports of gold from Russia. Life had been returning to normal in Kyiv after fierce resistance held off Russian advances in the early phase of the war, although air raid sirens regularly sound across the city.",
            "(U) There had been no major strikes on Kyiv since early June. In his nightly address, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a wounded seven-year-old girl was pulled from the rubble of a nine-storey apartment block. The girl's father was killed in the strike, he said. A Ukrainian air force spokesperson said the strike was carried out with 4-6 long-range missiles fired from Russian bombers more than 1,000km away in the southern Russian region of Astrakhan."

        author: "Simon Shuster",
        classification: "Unclassified",
        content: [
            "(U) The nights are the hardest, when he lies there on his cot, the whine of the air-raid sirens in his ears and his phone still buzzing beside him. Its screen makes his face look like a ghost in the dark, his eyes scanning messages he didn’t have a chance to read during the day. Some from his wife and kids, many from his advisers, a few from his troops, surrounded in their bunkers, asking him again and again for more weapons to break the Russian siege.",
            "(U) Inside his own bunker, the President has a habit of staring at his daily agenda even when the day is over. He lies awake and wonders whether he missed something, forgot someone. “It’s pointless,” Volodymyr Zelensky told me at the presidential compound in Kyiv, just outside the office where he sometimes sleeps. “It’s the same agenda. I see it’s over for today. But I look at it several times and sense that something is wrong.” It’s not anxiety that keeps his eyes from closing. “It’s my conscience bothering me.”",
            "(U) The same thought keeps turning over in his head: “I’ve let myself sleep, but now what? Something is happening right now.” Somewhere in Ukraine the bombs are still falling. Civilians are still trapped in basements or under the rubble. The Russians are still committing crimes of war, rape, and torture. Their bombs are leveling entire towns. The city of Mariupol and its last defenders are besieged. A critical battle has started in the east. Amid all this, Zelensky, the comedian turned President, still needs to keep the world engaged, and to convince foreign leaders that his country needs their help right now, at any cost.",
            "(U) Outside Ukraine, Zelensky told me, “People see this war on Instagram, on social media. When they get sick of it, they will scroll away.” It’s human nature. Horrors have a way of making us close our eyes. “It’s a lot of blood,” he explains. “It’s a lot of emotion.” Zelensky senses the world’s attention flagging, and it troubles him nearly as much as the Russian bombs. Most nights, when he scans his agenda, his list of tasks has less to do with the war itself than with the way it is perceived. His mission is to make the free world experience this war the way Ukraine does: as a matter of its own survival.",
            "(U) He seems to be pulling it off. The U.S. and Europe have rushed to his aid, providing more weapons to Ukraine than they have given any other country since World War II. Thousands of journalists have come to Kyiv, filling the inboxes of his staff with interview requests."

        content: [
            "(U) The Azovstal plant, the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the southern port city, has been under intense Russian bombardment for weeks. National Guard commander Denys Shlega said while some civilians had been evacuated, hundreds still remained.",
            '(U) He also said Russian forces had resumed heavy shelling of the area. As soon as the civilians who had been evacuated left, "shelling from all kinds of weapons began", he told Ukrainian television. He added that "several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant".',
            "(U) On Monday evening, footage emerged apparently showing a massive fire at the Azovstal, in what social media users said was a result of Russian bombardment. A first group of evacuees from the steelworks were expected to arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday - but the rescue efforts have run into delays, the BBC's Laura Bicker, who is in the city, reports.",
            "(U) It is not clear what is causing the hold-up, she says. The convoy is on its way, but the buses have hundreds of miles to travel along a road which is - in part - rubble. They also have to go through a number of Russian checkpoints. Those who left Mariupol on Monday were evacuated with the support of the United Nations (UN) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which organised an official convoy. Russia said some evacuees had been taken to a village controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. But state media later reported that they would be free to travel onwards to Ukrainian-held territory if they wanted to.",

            "(U) The British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British overseas territory in the Caribbean made up of 40 islands. It is a parliamentary democracy. Residents there elect a premier to be their leader, which has been Andrew Fahie since 2019. The Queen is head of state and is represented by a governor, which is currently John Rankin, appointed by the UK government. The BVI economy relies heavily on offshore finance, with financial services accounting for almost half of its GDP, and the 2017 'Panama Papers' investigation revealed it was a widely-used tax haven.",
            "(U) Last January judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom began an independent inquiry into corruption on the island. It has long faced allegations of state corruption, including allegations £5m of public money was spent on an imaginary airport. Mr Fahie's arrest this week does not relate to that investigation, Mr Rankin has confirmed.",
            "(U) The investigation into Mr Fahie was carried out by the DEA who used an informant and other undercover agents to liaise with him, his head of ports and her son. According to an affidavit by a DEA special agent, the probe began in mid-October 2021 when the informant met with a group of self-proclaimed operatives of the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah over claims they had business links to southern Florida. Over the course of several meetings, the informant asked the group to help use the island of Tortola on the BVI to ship cocaine from Colombia to the US."

            "(U) Scholz, in an interview broadcast Monday on ZDF public television, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had miscalculated if he had anticipated he might be able to gain territory from Ukraine, declare an end to hostilities, and see Western countries drop sanctions.",
            '(U) Scholz rejected criticism that he was at first too hesitant to send Ukraine heavy weapons, followed by criticism from pacifists after Germany last week announced the delivery of "Gepard" anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine.',
            "(U) Scholz is under pressure both at home and abroad to supply Ukraine with heavy arms such as tanks and howitzers and support an immediate EU embargo on Russian energy imports to strip Putin of hard currency that helps him finance the war."

            "(U) ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A federal judge on Friday sentenced a British terrorist to life in prison for his central role in the kidnap, torture and killing of Western hostages who were held by the Islamic State in Syria.",
            "(U) Alexanda Kotey, 38, was part of a brutal ISIS cell of Britons called the Beatles, a nickname given by their victims because of their accents. Mr. Kotey pleaded guilty last year to multiple charges that guaranteed he would spend the rest of his life behind bars.",
            "(U) Mr. Kotey admitted he was directly involved in the detention and hostage-taking of four Americans in 2012 and 2013, all of whom had traveled to Syria as journalists or to provide humanitarian aid and died in Islamic State custody: James Foley, Kayla Mueller, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig. Mr. Foley and Mr. Sotloff were beheaded in gruesome propaganda videos that stunned the world.",
            "(U) The executioner of the group, Mohammed Emwazi, also known as Jihadi John, was killed in an airstrike in Syria in 2015. During the sentencing on Friday, British and American families read statements describing their shattered lives. Mr. Kotey sat quietly and listened to parents and siblings recount their horror before and after the deaths of their loved ones.",
            '(U) “We are forever broken by the loss of our beloved son,” said Shirley Sotloff, whose son was executed in the Syrian desert in September 2014. “Open your eyes, please, and look at me. You destroyed our lives and we hope for the rest of your lives you will think about what you have done, and to your families as well.” After the families, along with a pair of Syrian detainees who had been captured with two of the Americans and later freed, concluded their comments, Judge T.S. Ellis III of the Federal District Court praised the dead hostages, saying they had moral courage and compassion.',
            '(U) He said the prosecution of Mr. Kotey was not revenge but the search for truth, describing Mr. Kotey’s conduct as “egregious, violent and inhumane.”',
            "(U) Judge Ellis sentenced Mr. Kotey to eight life sentences, which are to run at the same time and could land him at a high-security prison in Florence, Colo., called the supermax. Mr. Kotey’s lawyers had asked the judge to recommend sending Mr. Kotey to a prison with less severe restrictions, but he declined."

            "(U) Stromboli Pizza employee Gentrid Hasangjekaj, 21, told The Post he was toiling at the restaurant at 83 St. Marks Place on the corner of First Avenue in Manhattan around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday when a man he now recognizes as James entered — distraught, teary-eyed and seeking help.",
            "(U) James had allegedly unleashed smoke grenades and then a barrage of gunfire on a train in Brooklyn just 18 hours earlier, wounding 29 people, including 10 who were shot.",
            "(U) The worker said that before James entered the pizza joint, the suspect told four men eating slices outside that he was blind and asked if he could borrow one of their phones. It’s unclear if any of the men handed over their phone to James, but the suspect soon entered Stromboli and asked Hasangjekaj for his phone, the employee said. Hasangjekaj said he gave his phone to James, who then used it to call a number in Virginia Beach, Va., listed as belonging to a man and woman. James claimed the woman was his wife, Hasangjekaj said. The number is now disconnected.",
            "(U) Police told The Post on Saturday that they know of the reported pizza-shop encounter and that they will be following up on it."
