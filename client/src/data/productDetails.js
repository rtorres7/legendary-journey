The answer is “no!” You can get them both at the same time if you are eligible and the timing works. Experience with other vaccines has shown that immune response (the way our bodies develop protection) and possible side effects are generally the same whether you get one vaccine at a time or two. </p><p><span class="portion_marked_field"> (U) </span>Even though both vaccines can be given at the same visit, you should follow the recommended schedule for either vaccine: If you haven’t gotten your currently recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccine, get them as soon as you can, and ideally get a flu vaccine by the end of October. The same holds true for kids. If your child is eligible, they can get both vaccines at the same time, but don’t delay either vaccination in order to get them both at the same visit. </p><p><span class="portion_marked_field">(U) </span>A recent CDC study suggests people who received a flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster at the same time were slightly more likely (8% to 11%) to report reactions like fatigue, headache, and muscle ache than people who received only the COVID-19 booster, but these reactions were mostly mild and resolved quickly. If you have concerns about getting both vaccines at the same time, speak with your healthcare provider. <section class="ck-content info-box"><div class=""><p class=""><span class="portion_marked_field"> (U) </span><i>For additional information, please see the wires: </i><p><a href=""><span class="portion_marked_field"> (U) </span><i>Covid: Why you should consider vaccination.</i></a><i> 31 October 2021</i></p><p><a href=""><span class="portion_marked_field"> (U) </span><i>Covid and the flu: is the flu as deadly as Covid19?</i></a> <i> 18 December 2021</i></p></p></div></section></p>',

        "(U) President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia will not settle for anything less than victory in its invasion of the neighboring state, now in its 29th week. Still, the losses mark a major and unexpected strategic setback in Ukraine that could potentially mark a turning-point in the conflict, said two people close to the Defense Ministry and security services in Moscow.",
        "(U) The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, accused Russia in a tweet late on Sunday of “sending missiles to attempt to destroy critical civilian infrastructure,” in an apparent response to Kyiv’s liberation of territory that had been occupied by Russian forces.",
        "(U) The strikes hint at efforts to retaliate after a sudden breakthrough by Ukraine that sent Russian troops fleeing and put Moscow on the defensive. Ukraine’s top commander said that 3,000 square kilometers (1,158 square miles) of lost territory have been returned to Kyiv’s control since the beginning of September.",
        "(U) Peskov brushed off concerns over the hasty retreat in the northeast as Putin presided over a government meeting in Moscow at which he assured that the economy is returning to normal and has repelled the western sanctions imposed over the war. Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov announced that he was sending a new detachment to fight in Ukraine.",
        "(U) But with a lack of manpower and rapidly depleting equipment likely to become a growing concern for Russia’s forces, the risk is that Ukraine could try to cut off the Kremlin’s overstretched forces in the south and threaten Crimea, the person close to the Defense Ministry said.",

        "(U) Both COVID-19 and flu vaccines have been shown to reduce illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. As flu season approaches and COVID-19 vaccine recommendations are updated, you might be wondering if you need to wait after getting a flu vaccine before getting a COVID-19 vaccine? The answer is “no!” You can get them both at the same time if you are eligible and the timing works. Experience with other vaccines has shown that immune response (the way our bodies develop protection) and possible side effects are generally the same whether you get one vaccine at a time or two.",
        "(U) Even though both vaccines can be given at the same visit, you should follow the recommended schedule for either vaccine: If you haven’t gotten your currently recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccine, get them as soon as you can, and ideally get a flu vaccine by the end of October. The same holds true for kids. If your child is eligible, they can get both vaccines at the same time, but don’t delay either vaccination in order to get them both at the same visit.",
        "(U) A recent CDC study suggests people who received a flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster at the same time were slightly more likely (8% to 11%) to report reactions like fatigue, headache, and muscle ache than people who received only the COVID-19 booster, but these reactions were mostly mild and resolved quickly. If you have concerns about getting both vaccines at the same time, speak with your healthcare provider.",
